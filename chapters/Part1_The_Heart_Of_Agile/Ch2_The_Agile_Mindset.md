# Chapter 2

# The Agile Mindset vs. Agile in Name Only

## Agile Process Theatre

How agile became process theatre: standups without purpose, not understanding the reason for rituals, roles and artifacts. A fool with a tool is still a fool.

## Common Mistunderstandings

Scrum and agile are the same
Speed is the most important thing, not value
Story points, not complexity points

## The Cost of Cargo Cults: One 'Way of Working'

The need to streamline the 'Way of Working' despite team differences.
Ritual action and the expectation of rational results from irrational means.
The loss of trust
The cost of failure fatigue
The cost of not feeling your purpose and/or feeling your value
Being a slave to the process
