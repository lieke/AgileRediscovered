# Chapter 3

# Patterns of Decay

## Scaling

If you scale too fast you loose culture

## Command and control

Command and control disguised as 'agile governance'
Are we 'unSAFE at any speed'?

## The six sigma and budget cycle curse

Overemphasis on predictability, underemphasis on adaptability

## Metrics

Metrics abuse:
What you measure is what you get: what do you actually want and how to measure those things are difficult. Even the DORA metrics can be problematic (MTTR as a great example)
What _never_ not to use as performance indicator: story points, LOC etc
