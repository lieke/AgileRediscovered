# The Craft Of Quality

## Quality isn't a trade-off

Iron triangle: cost, time, scope -- you can only choose two.
If you choose 3 you will inevitably loose quality

TDD, CI/CD and refactoring (boyscout rule) shoud be part of the culture

## Slow is fast

Comparison to rowing, slow controlled and strong strokes will produce more than chaotic and fast strokes.
There is a contrast: "faster now, slower forever" vs "sustainable pace".
Technical debt collects interest and you will have to deal with it eventually
