# No Silver Bullets

No framework is a silver bullet. Not Lean, not Scrum, not Kanban, not Cynefin, not Design Thinking. You have to really understand these frameworks and apply them. They are not religion.

That does not mean that they are without merit!

Scaling Agile can be hard, especially for management that haven't embraced the Agile principles (welcoming change, build around motivated individuals, self-organisation, radical transparency and the psychological safety to do that, technical excellence, simplicity, sustainable pace)

The issues with SAFE, uniformity to avoid management having to really change

## Lean 6 sigma

## Empowered Product Teams

## ITIL

## The Spotify Model

## DevOps

## IT4IT

## One Tool to Rule Them All

A fool with a tool is still a fool
